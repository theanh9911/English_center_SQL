# üìö English Center - Relational Database System

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction

The English center information management system is built on the SQL platform. The system was created to help update information of students, teachers, and center managers more easily.
The system has main functions such as: managing classrooms, shifts, schedules, classes, teacher and student information, information about courses at the center and the learning results of students.
